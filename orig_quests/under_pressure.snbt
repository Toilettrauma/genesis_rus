For that we'll need you to reconstruct one of our pressure chambers and a device to generate pressure. The first thing you'll need is to compress iron. Normally you'd use a pressure chamber for this but until you have fortified materials to make it you'll need to use an explosion to accomplish this. Craft some TNT and blow up some iron!"
