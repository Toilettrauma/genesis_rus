				"Electrodynamics cables and 120V machines c&lan output power directly to machines that accept FE&r. This means they will connect to cable connectors, capacitors, batteries, and FE machines. It is important to note this automatic conversion ONLY works for 120V power sources. "
				""
				"Once you ramp up to 240V and beyond, you MUST use an electric motor to convert to FE energy. Attempting to directly power FE machinery or connectors with anything other than 120V will result in an &lEXPLOSION.&r"

				"FE and Electrodynamic Powersources and be used for IC2 by using an EU Converter. This will convert the FE power into usable EU packets. The IC2 insulated cables carry EU energy and are used for all IC2 Classic machines. Each cable has a voltage tier (LV, MV, HV, etc.). Hooking a power source that is too high up to a machine will blow it up. "
				""
				""
				"Each machine should say what tier of power it uses, and you can add transformer upgrades to allow it to accept higher voltages. The rule of thumb is always to connect your machines with a cable of the appropriate tier so that even if you hook the wrong power up, you will only burn your cables instead of the machine. "
				""
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"Lastly, we have FE power cables; these will be your immersive engineering wires and later mekanism universal cables."
				""
				"These are the most straightforward. The wires are limited in only how much energy they can transfer at once; they will burn if you try to connect too many devices, but your machines will always be safe. Also, look out for walking into uninsulated wires; it can be shocking. The Mekanism universal cables are the final tier and have no such restriction. "
